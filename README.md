# Quadruped-Walking-Robot

Designed a quadruped walking robot, with 2-DOF planar legs, to have a constant walking velocity of 0.1 m/s.

**Gait Planning:** Planned a regular forward wave gait with a duty factor of 0.75 as show below in the form of kinematics phase diagram.

**Foot Trajectory Planning:** Came up with a smooth continuous foot trajectory in which the foot lifts up and touches down vertically. Shown the position and velocity plots for the foot tip of each leg during one complete walking cycle time.

**Joint Angles:** Calculated the angles of all joints for one complete walking cycle time and showed the results in 6 plots: one plot per leg – each plot/leg includes two joints.

***Plots would look similar for all the legs***

***Joint Velocities:*** Calculated the angular velocities of all joints for one complete walking cycle time and showed the results in 6 plots: one plot per leg – each plot/leg includes two joints.
